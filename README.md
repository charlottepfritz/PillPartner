## Overview

This project was done as a part of ECE342 at the University of Toronto during Winter 2024. For our project, we created an automated pill dispenser using various hardware components and microcontrollers. The system is designed to dispense pills at scheduled times, ensuring medication adherence for users. 

## Features

- Scheduled pill dispensing
- User-friendly interface via LCD screen
- WiFi connectivity for remote monitoring and control
- Audible and visual alerts for dispensing and refilling
- Secure pill storage with motorized rotating mechanism

## Hardware Requirements

- Arduino Uno
- ESP8266 WiFi module
- STM32 microcontroller
- Servo motor
- LCD screen
- Motor driver
- Push buttons
- LEDs
- Buzzer
- Miscellaneous electronic components (resistors, wires, etc.)

## Software Requirements

- Arduino IDE
- STM32CubeIDE
- Libraries for ESP8266 WiFi module and LCD screen (if not included in IDE)
